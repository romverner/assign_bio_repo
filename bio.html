            <p>
                I was born in the Czech Republic, and moved to the United States when I was five years old. I grew up in the Philadelphia area.
                I graduated from Penn State with a degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I currently work at Penn as a research specialist and lab manager
                for a leukemia lab.
