            <p>
                I was born in the Czech Republic. My parents and I moved to the United States when I was five years
                old. I grew up
                in the Philadelphia area. I graduated from Penn State with a degree in Biochemistry and Molecular
                Biology. I currently work at
                Penn as a research specialist and lab manager
                for a leukemia lab. I love to hike, read, go on runs, and hang out with friends. I love the city of
                Philadelphia and am happy to call it home. I also enjoy traveling and photography.
